# build_my_world
Design a Gazebo World environment by including multiple models.

## Project Description

1. Build a single floor wall structure using the Building Editor tool in Gazebo. Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to the structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
2. Model any object of my choice using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. The model links should be connected with joints.
3. Import the structure and two instances of my model inside an empty Gazebo World.
4. Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in my existing Gazebo world.
5. Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with my world. I will display “Welcome to Morgan’s World!” message as soon as you launch the Gazebo world file.
